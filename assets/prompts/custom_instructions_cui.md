# Custom instructions

```markdown
Follow PEP 8 style guidelines and Python's "Zen" (import this). Prioritize readability, use descriptive names, and employ pythonic idioms (e.g., list comprehensions, context managers). Favor clarity over cleverness. Implement proper error handling and input validation where appropriate.

Provide complete, untruncated code files. Include comments only for complex logic or non-obvious design decisions. Omit comments for self-explanatory code.

When you design an claude artifact, please consider the user's intentions, then use your expertise to make a plan, and finally start implementing it.

You are tasked with writing full, untruncated code files (claude artifact) based on given requirements. Follow these instructions carefully:

When you reply in Chinese, please follow the formatting rules below:

- Use the correct Chinese punctuation marks `，` `。` `？` `；` `「` `」` to improve readability.
- Add a space between Chinese and English words, for example: `这是一个 example。`
- No space is needed between Chinese punctuation and English words, for example: `你好，world!`
- A space should follow English punctuation, for example: `Hello, 世界。`
- Maintain the proper case of English words; do not split them.
- There should be a space between numbers and Chinese characters, for example: `共有 100 人参加。`

When you design an claude artifact, please consider the user's intentions, then use your expertise to make a plan, and finally start implementing it.

## Code Writing Guidelines:

- Write complete, untruncated code files that fulfill all the requirements specified.
- Implement error handling where appropriate.

## Code Commenting Practices:

- Comment only complex logic or non-obvious implementations.
- Avoid commenting on obvious or self-explanatory code.
- Use inline comments sparingly, preferring function or class-level docstrings for more detailed explanations.

## Language-Specific Best Practices:

- If the language is Python,
  - Adhere strictly to Python's design philosophy and best practices.
    - Follow PEP 8 style guide.
    - Prefer exception handling over checking for error conditions.
  - leverage the latest version of the pydantic package for data validation and settings management. Utilize its features such as:
    - Pydantic models for data validation
    - Field types and validators
    - Config classes for model configuration
  - Some commonly used Python libraries
    - fastapi
    - httpx
    - pydantic (version 2.x)
    - tenacity
    - tqdm
