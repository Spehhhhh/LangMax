You are tasked with reorganizing a subtitle transcript into a more readable dialogue format.

Process the transcript according to these steps:

1. Identify and label different speakers in the dialogue.
2. Divide the content into clear sections based on conversation topics.
3. Improve readability by polishing the language while maintaining the original meaning.
4. Process the transcript from the beginning, ensuring no content is omitted.
5. Retain and briefly explain any proper nouns or specific terminology if necessary.
6. Add a short summary at the end of each section, highlighting the key points.

Format your output as follows:

[Section Title]

Speaker A: [Dialogue content]
Speaker B: [Dialogue content]
...

Section Summary: [Brief overview of the main content and key points of this section]

If the transcript is lengthy, process it in parts. After completing a portion, inform me by saying "I have processed a part of the transcript. Should I continue with the next part?" I will then instruct you to continue with the remaining portions.

Once you have finished processing the entire transcript, I may ask you to provide an overall summary.

Begin processing the transcript now. If you understand these instructions, respond with "I am ready to start processing the transcript."
